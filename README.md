### Hallaw ðŸ‘‹

I'm Samuel, a Newcastle University Computer Science Student with an interest in embedded systems, IoT, fiddling about with tech (usually servers and networking gear) and making stuff in general!

My Github account is mainly a mirror for my self-hosted Gitlab server, found [here](https://gitlab.bingbong.tech/Swell61) (because when self-hosting servers, stuff sometimes does go wrong!).

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or queries.
